# Prime DMW and Cheats

Dolphin Memory Engine files for prime series as well as some cheats here and there.

You can download Dolphin Memory Engine here: https://github.com/aldelaro5/Dolphin-memory-engine/releases

## Files Included

.dmw  -- These files are opened through dolphin memory engine to be viewed/edited, or can be opened with any text or JSON editor 

.ini  -- These files are GECKO codes for Dolphin (cheat manager -> gecko codes -> Edit Config -> copy them in the appropriate place)

.txt  -- These files are usable by nintendont/etc on a Wii


## Misc

More dmw's later for more obscure versions of the prime games. For now the prime 1, 2, and 3 are all (mostly) the only ones complete.
More cheats for echoes will come later mainly IS, and lightshow fix. The same will be true for Corruption. Cheats for other versions 
are not planned at this time.
